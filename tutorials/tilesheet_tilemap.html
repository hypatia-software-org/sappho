<h1>Creating a tilesheet and a map<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-tilesheet-and-a-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this short tutorial, we&#8217;ll go over how to create a simple tilesheet,
and use the Tiled editor to create a tilemap.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-tilesheet">
<h2>Creating a tilesheet<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-tilesheet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tilesheet is an image made up of smaller images that represents
a tile. A simple tilesheet, with 10x10 pixel tiles, would look like
this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilesheet.png" src="../_images/tilesheet.png" />
<p>Tiles are indexed from zero in Sappho, and indexing goes right then down.
Let&#8217;s look at an annotated and enlarged version of the above tilesheet:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilesheet_annotated.png" src="../_images/tilesheet_annotated.png" />
<p>To start creating a tilesheet, you need to decide on a couple of things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The size of the tiles. All tiles in the tilesheet will share the
same size, but if you run out of room, you can always make one thing
span multiple tiles (you&#8217;d just have to arrange them right when it
comes to creating your map)</li>
<li>How many tiles you need in your tilesheet. You can always resize it
later, but it&#8217;s a good idea to keep the width of the tilesheet the
same, so you don&#8217;t throw out your tile indexing (remember, right then
down). If you resize your tilesheet to add more tiles at the bottom,
all the tiles above the resize will keep the same tile ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s create a simple 4-tile tilesheet. We&#8217;ll make each tile 10x10 pixels,
which means we&#8217;ll have a 20x20 tilesheet image.</p>
<p>Create a new image in your favorite image editing program (for the sake
of the tutorial, we&#8217;ll use GIMP) and set the size to 20x20 pixels.</p>
<p>Once the image is created, delete the background layer and create four
new layers, named Tile 0 through to Tile 3. Then, add guides at the
boundary of the tiles, by dragging down from the ruler at the top and
left, and place the guides at 10 pixels in from those sides. This will
give us our 2x2 tile grid to work with.</p>
<p>Once that&#8217;s done, you should have an environment that looks like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilesheet_creation_guides.png" src="../_images/tilesheet_creation_guides.png" />
<p>Let&#8217;s start creating our tiles.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s create a grass tile, which will act as the background of
our map. Select the Tile 0 layer, and fill the top-left square with green,
by selecting the Rectangle Select Tool in GIMP. This is in your tool
palette on the left of the screen, and  should be the first icon. Drag
from the top-left corner down to the center of the image, meeting the
guides. Then select the bucket fill tool (which looks like a paint
bucket), select a green color by clicking on the black square below the
tool palette and choosing a color in the dialog that pops up, click OK,
and click on the selected square.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s our first tile done! Now let&#8217;s create a few more. For the next
tile, let&#8217;s create a black square with a blue border. Later on, we&#8217;ll
make this block solid, so the player can&#8217;t walk through it. Switch to
the Tile 1 layer, select the whole square and fill it with blue. Then,
select the square again, but one pixel in from the edge on all sides,
and fill that with black. You should now have a tilesheet that looks
like this: (I took some liberties and added a smiley face)</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilesheet_creation_stageone.png" src="../_images/tilesheet_creation_stageone.png" />
<p>It&#8217;s up to you what to do with the other two tiles, but for the sake
of the tutorial, I&#8217;ll add another grass tile with some texture, and
a tree.</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilesheet_creation_stagetwo.png" src="../_images/tilesheet_creation_stagetwo.png" />
<p>Save this as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tilesheet.png</span></code> in a new folder.</p>
<div class="section" id="tilesheet-rules">
<h3>Tilesheet rules<a class="headerlink" href="#tilesheet-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, we have to create the rules file for our tilesheet.</p>
<p>Tilesheet rule files take a simple format. Each line consists of a tile
ID, followed by an equals sign, then any flags that the given tile has.</p>
<p>The only flag that is currently implemented is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solid_block</span></code>. This
means that the tile can not be walked through by the player. We&#8217;ll
set this flag on our box tile and our tree tile in this example, but
if you had something else on your mind for the other two tiles in the
previous section, this may differ.</p>
<p>The tilesheet rules file name is simply the name of your tilesheet
image file, with &#8221;.rules&#8221; appended. Let&#8217;s create the rules file for our
example tilesheet:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">solid_block</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">solid_block</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Easy! Save it as &#8220;tilesheet.png.rules&#8221; in the same folder as your
tilesheet image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-tilemap">
<h2>Creating a tilemap<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-tilemap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To get started creating a map, you&#8217;ll need to install the
<a class="reference external" href="http://mapeditor.org">Tiled map editor</a>. Once you have it installed,
start it up and create a new map. You&#8217;ll need to double check the
map settings before continuing though - they should look like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilemap_tiled_newmap.png" src="../_images/tilemap_tiled_newmap.png" />
<p>You can set the map size to whatever you want, but make sure the tile
size is set to the same size as your tiles in the tilesheet (in the
example, 10x10 pixels). Click OK, and you&#8217;ll be presented with a blank
editor canvas.</p>
<p>The first step is to add the tilesheet you created to the map. To do
this, under the Tilesets heading on the bottom right, click the New icon.</p>
<p>In the dialog that comes up, click Browse, and find your tilesheet.
The window should now look like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilemap_tiled_tileset_new.png" src="../_images/tilemap_tiled_tileset_new.png" />
<p>Click OK, and your tilesheet should now appear in the Tilesets section
of the editor window. Because we&#8217;re working with very small tiles, you
may want to zoom in, which you can do by adjusting the percentage
displayed below the tilesets section. There should be another percentage
below this, and that is the zoom level for the editor, which you probably
want to adjust as well, so you can see what you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>Click on your grass tile in the tilesets section, and it will appear
highlighted. This means that it&#8217;s selected, and you can now place it on
the map! Let&#8217;s fill our map with grass tiles to start. Select the
bucket fill tool from the top of the window, and click in the center of
the editor screen. You should now see a green square in the center.
Congratulations! That&#8217;s the first step towards creating a map.</p>
<p>Before we can place other objects around, like our solid block (or the
tree I created), we need to create a new map layer. This means that
the grass blocks are still in the background, and whatever we place
on the new layer will sit above the grass. This is particularly important
for the tree that I created in my example - it&#8217;s background is
transparent, meaning that if I place it instead of a grass block, just
black will appear in the background.</p>
<p>Creating a new layer is easy, though - just click the New button in the
Layers section (above the tileset section), and click Add Tile Layer.
Now that we have created the layer for our objects, let&#8217;s place them.</p>
<p>Since we selected the bucket fill tool earlier to fill our map with
grass, we have to switch back to the Stamp Brush tool by clicking it
at the top of the window. Then, click on a tile in our tilesheet, and
click anywhere on the map to place it.</p>
<p>You should now have a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/tilemap_tiled_complete.png" src="../_images/tilemap_tiled_complete.png" />
<p>Now, save the tilemap in the same directory as your tilesheet, naming
it &#8220;tilemap.tmx&#8221; (&#8221;.tmx&#8221; is the file extension for Tiled maps).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully created a tilesheet and a map that
uses it. Take a moment to marvel in your creation, you deserve it.</p>
